        <p class="paragraph">
            I am an experienced software engineer with a strong and diverse scientific background and a passion for
            JVM-based technologies.
            I bring over 5 years of in-depth experience in designing, developing, and deploying robust, scalable backend
            systems.
            My expertise spans across working with cutting-edge technologies, from fast-paced startup environments to
            roles in stable tech companies.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            My proficiency extends beyond programming to include deploying services in a cloud Kubernetes environment,
            and testing and monitoring.
            I am driven by the challenge of transforming complex business requirements into high-quality, scalable
            software solutions that deliver real value.</p>

                <p>Arrival was a pioneering British electric vehicle (EV) startup where I contributed to three
                    projects.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>At the ProductHub Team:

                                I led the integration of these services into the company-wide federated GraphQL
                                architecture and was responsible for their deployment into a cloud Kubernetes cluster.

                            <li>Developed a microservice to capture leads from the website, store them in a NoSQL
                                database, and route them to external systems (e.g., Airtable, mailing system) based on
                                specific conditions.
                            </li>
